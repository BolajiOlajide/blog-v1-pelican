Hello and welcome!

After 14 variations and experimenting with tools like GatsbyJS, NextJS, NuxtJS, Ghost, Hugo, and Django, I am excited to finally launch my blog.

I was basically playing around with most of these tools as I didn't have a set idea of what I wanted at the time. Anyway, that's over now seeing that I have launched it.

This site is based on [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html), a Python static site generator. I like to call my implementation **"PAMSTACK"** - a sibling of the popular **JAMSTACK** which makes use of Javascript.

I'll be sharing a lot of my learnings here. Backticks & Tildes will still house a lot of my tutorials until I figure out what to do with it.
For videos of learnings I don't have the urge to write about, you can find them at [vlog[dot]bolaji[dot]de](http://vlog.bolaji.de).

You can find the source code of my blog [here](https://github.com/BolajiOlajide/blog).
